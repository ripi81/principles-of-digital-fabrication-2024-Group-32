# principles-of-digital-fabrication-2024-Group-32
The repository of our project on the Principles of Digital Fabrication course spring 2024 of Group 32

This is the repository for the documentation of our course project of Group 32 consisting of Hanna Risteli, Siiri Tuomikoski, Laura Saraj√§rvi and Tatu Tallavaara.

**This repository contains:**
1) The code for our project
2) The electronic circuit diagrams 
3) The .svg files for our final, full sized version of the 2D laser cutting design which we built our prototype with:
   finaal6_5.svg
   finalboksi6_5.svg
   koskettimet_akryyli_2024touko3.svg
   nappaintuki_boksiin_touko3.svg
5) The .svg file of the previous plywood box prototype from Friday, April 19th
6) The slides for our project presentation (file name Presentation_Group32.odp) 

**Keyboard features:**
- 8 notes which play the C major scale
- 4 tone polyphony with one basic magnetic buzzer

**Notes** (by Siiri)

KeyboardInstrument1.3.ino is the code that is running on the Arduino. 1.4 is a version that addresses the problems with the 1.3 code, but unfortunately I couldn't finish the code in time. I still wanted to include it in this repo, as it was very close to functioning as intended. 

testichoco.ino is a demo song (Chocobo theme from the popular video game series Final Fantasy!) that plays a 3-tone polyphonic melody correctly on the Arduino. Initially we wanted to include this "demo song" functionality in our project but unfortunately we ran out of time. The code works just as intended and I have included an audio recording of it (Record-009.wav).
